- name: Evaluation of Long term outcomes of early intervention of psychosis service
  description: >
    One of the key questions in establishing the early intervention service for psychosis is whether the shortterm effect of the early intervention service can sustain in the long term. The early intervention service in different countries is usually about 2-3 years. There have been some studies on the medium term effect of early intervention service such as 5-7 years, studies on longer term effect is limited. We have conducted studies systematically evaluating 10-year outcomes of early intervention service compared with the standard care and results have contributed to this gap of research.

- name: Exploring the Neurobiological Basis of Psychosis
  description: >
    Our research focuses on understanding how disruptions in brain systems give rise to psychotic symptoms. We use cutting-edge techniques—ranging from neuroimaging to molecular assays—to pinpoint the genetic, cellular, and circuit-level abnormalities that underlie psychosis. By clarifying these neural mechanisms, we aim to inform the development of more effective diagnostic tools and treatments for individuals affected by psychotic disorders.

  
- name: Treatment resistant schizophrenia
  description: >
      Though antipsychotic medication is effective in ameliorating positive symptoms of patients with schizophrenia, about 20-40% of patients are not responding to the current form of antipsychotic medications and are considered as treatment resistant. They are often the group of patients with poorer outcomes and require more health care resources. Clozapine is the only antipsychotic medication found to be effective in treating treatment resistant schizophrenia, yet only about 60% of patients are responding. Therefore understanding the mechanisms of treatment resistant schizophrenia and predictors can help to improve our care to this group of patients.​

- name: Social cognition in schizophrenia and across psychiatric disorders
  description: >
    Our research explores how social cognitive processes—such as mentalizing, gaze perception, and emotion recognition—contribute to schizophrenia and other mental health conditions. By comparing these processes across diagnostic groups, we aim to uncover shared mechanisms and pinpoint condition-specific factors. This work informs targeted interventions designed to improve social functioning and overall outcomes for individuals with diverse psychiatric presentations.
